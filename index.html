          <h2>Queen of Melody Nightingale of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Lata Mangeshkar</b>, also known as the 'Nightingale of India',
            was one of the most versatile singers in the Indian film industry.
            Lata was born on September 28, 1929, to classical singer and theatre
            artist Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar and Shevanti in Indore, Madhya
            Pradesh. Her father started teaching her music at an early age. By
            the time she was five, Lata was seen participating as an actress in
            plays written by her father. Her siblings - Meena, Asha, Usha, and
            Hridaynath - are all accomplished singers and musicians. In a career
            spanning nearly eight decades, Lata Mangeshkar was the singing voice
            for a bevy of Bollywood leading ladies. She lent her voice to over
            5,000 songs in over a thousand Hindi and 36 regional films. She had
            an unprecedented impact on Indian film music. Since 1942, Lata
            pushed back the boundaries of music with her mind-boggling skills.
            Over the years, Lata had sung for actresses from Madhubala to
            Priyanka Chopra. Best known for her versatile voice quality, she
            recorded albums of all kinds (ghazals, pop, etc).
